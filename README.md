# A "3D Game"
Uses raycasting to display a doom-like "3D" map. Runs in the terminal although not very well. May work better in IDLE but i dont have it installed to check. I made a pygame version as well that works better but its in a bit of a broken state and i didnt know how git worked at the time :(.
